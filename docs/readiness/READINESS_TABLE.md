# Relay readiness table

Status date: **2026-09-16** / commit `3af3538` / branch `main`

> Relayは119、消防・警察・自治体の公式な緊急連絡手段の代替ではありません。 本ファイルのどの状態も、実災害での救助や自治体・消防の承認を保証しません。

State axes are independent: `IMPLEMENTED` and `AUTOMATED_TESTED` never imply `DEVICE_TESTED` or `FIELD_TESTED`.

## Notes per feature

- `sos-rescue-request`: JVM unit tests only; no claim about physical device behavior.
- `encrypted-storage`: Instrumentation execution is an emulator/device lane, not part of the default PR lane.
- `continuous-gps-tracking`: Background location, location FGS, and periodic tracking are deliberately not implemented. Kept NOT_IMPLEMENTED rather than partially coded: shipping unapproved background tracking would violate the privacy boundary this project documents.
- `armed-emergency-state`: Persistent state, degrade/recovery, and communication lease covered by unit tests only.
- `auto-disaster-detection`: Design only; no code path claims detection. The Gateway-side official-information provenance pipeline (jma-xml-feed feature) is the code-verifiable part and is tracked separately.
- `nearby-relay`: RF behavior cannot be proven without physical devices.
- `nearby-connection-policy`: Fail-closed allow-list enforced in unit tests; distribution operations incomplete.
- `gateway-enrollment-core`: relay-gw:1: token validation, conflicting beacon rejection, manifest pinning.
- `gateway-enrollment-ui`: Screen and scanner are implemented (commit de6850a). Camera hardware behavior and real-LAN enrollment remain device work.
- `broker-manifest-enrollment`: Development-only path; disabled in release/pilotRelease.
- `ble-gateway-trust-chain`: Verification logic tested with fixtures; no formal trust anchors exist.
- `pc-gateway-console`: Windows validation lane runs Gateway build, tests, and /api/health smoke.
- `https-broker`: Broker never decrypts rescue bodies; production infrastructure is external.
- `broker-observability-minimal`: Coarse category logging only: auth failures, invalid proofs, rate limits.
- `packaged-e2e`: Scheduled heavy lane; loopback processes, not real network topology.
- `broker-high-availability`: Single SQLite instance; no HA claim possible. Resilience that IS code-verifiable (crash-safe WAL persistence, exactly-once relay under injected network faults, load behavior) is tracked and tested under broker-resilience/load features instead.
- `android6-compat`: Managed-device lane defined; API 23 emulator execution not part of default PR lane.
- `windows-validation`: 0-test results are treated as failure; JUnit XML presence is enforced.
- `device-test-harness`: Script existence does not mean device PASS.
- `coverage-kover`: Visualization only; no threshold enforcement yet.
- `build-reproducibility`: Debug APK comparison only; full-artifact reproducibility unproven.
- `dependency-security-scan`: report-only in PR lane; block-high-critical in formal release.
- `fuzz-decoders`: Deterministic seed-corpus regression on PR; continuous fuzzing opt-in.
- `formal-release`: The gate exists and fails closed without organization secrets. No formal release has ever been produced; the workflow result is BLOCKED_EXTERNAL until keys exist.
- `ios-preview`: Simulator build evidence only; no physical iPhone claim.
- `training-mode`: Gateway/Broker training isolation is fail-closed and the staff console banner is driven by the server health flag. Android app training mode (device-side banner and store separation) is a documented follow-up; offline map tiles are deliberately shared (public GSI data).
- `official-info-provenance`: Provenance is transport-honest only: no trust anchors exist for JMA/CAP publishers, so content authenticity is never claimed; staff console renders the verification state. CAP/Atom parsers are not yet wired to a live polling source (JMA XML feed polling remains a documented future activation trigger).
- `dpapi-key-protection`: Opt-in per-user DPAPI at-rest protection (default remains file-permissions); deliberately not claimed as HSM/TPM/KMS - the blob opens only for the same Windows user on the same machine, and machine-loss recovery requires re-provisioning.
- `data-retention`: The engine covers decrypted terminal rescue details (the personal-data store); message/audit stores have their own size bounds. The 30-day default is a pilot value pending privacy/legal owner approval and is now operator-configurable within approved bounds.
- `codeql-analysis`: Executed successfully on GitHub-hosted runners for the merged dependency/security update; this is automated static-analysis evidence only.
- `secret-scanning-gitleaks`: Both the checksum-pinned local scan and the GitHub-hosted CI scan have completed successfully.
- `workflow-lint-zizmor`: All checkouts use persist-credentials:false; publish workflows retain only job-level write permissions where required.
- `dependency-review`: Runs only for pull requests and requires the GitHub dependency graph; both prerequisites were satisfied for PR #53.
- `scorecard-monitoring`: Honestly gated to the default branch; will not produce results until merged there.
- `dependabot-updates`: Configuration only; GitHub activates it server-side once present on the default branch.
- `branch-protection`: CI cannot verify repository settings; remains blocked until the owner applies and confirms them.
- `gradle-dependency-verification`: Generated on Windows; platform-specific artifacts for ubuntu/macos CI lanes may need additions (fail-closed, documented).
- `release-provenance-attestation`: Real attestation requires an actual formal release run on GitHub; not executable locally.
- `detekt-static-analysis`: 1294 existing findings are recorded as baseline debt (0 ForbiddenImport); the checksum-pinned CLI rejects new findings and ran successfully in GitHub Actions.
- `property-based-testing`: kotest-property 5.9.1 pinned in verification-metadata.xml (sha256); JUnit4 + runBlocking bridge; :relay-protocol:test green under active dependency verification.
- `mutation-testing`: PIT 1.17.4 via info.solidsoft.pitest 1.15.0, pinned in verification-metadata.xml; targetTests set explicitly because the plugin default silently skipped tests outside the targetClasses package (false NO_COVERAGE); PIT analysis drove the tamper property from 5 to all 15 canonical fields.
- `architecture-tests`: ArchUnit 1.4.1 (archunit-junit4) runs inside :pc-gateway:test whose classpath contains all JVM production modules (relay-protocol, shared-jvm, pc-gateway, broker); :pc-gateway:test --rerun-tasks 97 tests 0 failures. Android-only modules (app, composeApp) are outside this JVM import and remain covered only by their own unit tests.
- `broker-api-contract`: Contract conformance checks only (not_a_server_error, status/content-type/headers/schema conformance); positive_data_acceptance and negative_data_rejection are deliberately excluded because signature-requiring endpoints legitimately answer documented 401s to generated data - positive-path coverage with real ECDSA proofs stays in the Kotlin integration tests. The ~33-route PC Gateway staff/bridge API is not yet specified and remains a follow-up.
- `broker-resilience-load`: Required testcontainers 2.0.5: Docker Engine 29 rejects the pre-1.44 API negotiation of testcontainers 1.x with HTTP 400 (1.21.3 verified failing locally, 2.0.5 verified passing). Full :broker:test suite 54 tests / 0 failures. The load test is a correctness-under-load gate with a 10s p95 sanity bound, explicitly NOT a calibrated capacity or SLA benchmark; Toxiproxy tests have not yet executed on a GitHub runner.
